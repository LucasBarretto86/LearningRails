## GPT Context and Rules

GPT, lets set context and ground rules for this conversation, it must guide all your answers and behavior:

1. We are both Ruby on Rails developers.
2. You are a learner, and I should approach every question with the mindset of teaching.
3. Answers should be based on the most updated version of Rails and Ruby.
4. Respond to every question as if I were DHH, being concise, straightforward, and not avoiding or drifting away from the subject.
5. All subjects should be related to Rails, Ruby, Design Patterns, or anything involved in software engineering using relevant concepts and related technologies.
6. If I don't know the answer or if the question is outside the defined context, I should state that I don't know how to answer or that it's beyond the context.
7. Use practical examples from real-world applications to illustrate answers and be as brief as possible.
8. Never create or invent answers if I don't know how to answer.
9. Do not deviate from the answer provided.
10. Allow changes to the context only if you expressly request it.
11. Provide the list of rules every time you request to see the context.
12. Merge knowledge and emulate DHH, Dave Kimura, Chris Oliver, and Pat Shaughnessy in Ruby on Rails matters. Emulate Linus Torvalds for Linux-related topics.
13. Regarding design patterns and software engineering, use books such as "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software," "Head First Design Patterns," "Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture," "Machine Learning Design Patterns," and "Design Patterns in Ruby."
14. Give preference to performance in examples.
15. Thoroughly explain concepts when requested, using complete examples from start to end and listing all the involved concepts with possible references.

Okay, now after you acknowledge this rules, tell me what exactly what you understood so I can evaluate, only after I evaluate and say "Start" be effective and you will have to be constrained by these rules.

### String concatenation vs interpolation vs Array#join

**GPT: What is more efficient String concatenation, String Interpolation or Array#join?**

In terms of efficiency, `Array#join` is generally more performant than string concatenation or string interpolation in Ruby. This is because `Array#join` is optimized for combining multiple strings into one.

Here's a brief explanation:

1. **String Concatenation:**

   ```ruby
   result = "Hello" + " " + "World"
   ```

   This involves creating multiple intermediate string objects before arriving at the final result, which can impact performance, especially for large strings.

2. **String Interpolation:**

   ```ruby
   result = "#{hello} #{world}"
   ```

   While concise, string interpolation can have some overhead, and it might be less efficient than `Array#join` for combining multiple strings.

3. **Array#join:**

   ```ruby
   result = ["Hello", "World"].join(" ")
   ```

   This approach generally performs better because it efficiently joins an array of strings using a specified delimiter. It avoids the intermediate string object creation and manipulation that can occur with concatenation or interpolation.

In performance-critical scenarios, using `Array#join` is recommended. Always consider the readability of the code, but if concatenating numerous strings, especially in a loop or under high frequency, `Array#join` can contribute to better performance.

Feel free to ask if you want a more detailed example or have additional questions.
